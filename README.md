# broma2ida

Quick and dirty tool to generate IDC from a broma file

An ida script would be more appropiate but I don't have the time to make a good one at the moment.

# Quick start

Auto-generated scripts are available on /out

# Import

Before importing it is recommended to make a **backup** of your current database, as you can't restore names automatically as far as I know

Selecting file (make sure the script has .idc extension)

File -> Script File

Or:
- File -> Script Command (Shift + F12)
- **MAKE SURE TO SET SCRIPTING LANGUAGE TO IDC!!!!**
- Paste the script
- Run
